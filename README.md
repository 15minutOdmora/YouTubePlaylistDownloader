# YouTube Playlist Downloader
Simple youtube playlist downloader. 
It's mostly meant to download music as it only downloads videos in a MP4 format.

Beta version, there are still bugs.

If something went wrong (program didn't work correctly) it could be due to an internal error, but is most likely due to:

### Possible Errors (Program not working correctly):
#### Playlist didn't load up:
- Playlist is set to private
- Bad internet connection (it has to be really bad to not work)
- Incorrect URL (it's not a YouTube playlist)
- Unknown error 

#### If a certain video wasn't downloaded:
- It was deleted from the playlist (no longer exists)
- It was blocked by YouTube (could be any reason)
- Blocked in country
- Bad internet connection
- Server connection error or unavailable format
- Unknown error


## Guide
![UiPreview](https://github.com/15minutOdmora/YouTubePlaylistDownloader/blob/master/YPT_Beta_UI.png)

- Paste/type in the URL of your playlist, check that the playlist is set to public, and then press Load.
- Loading videos from playlist may take a while, depending on the size of the playlist. Around 5 seconds for a 10 song playlist.
- You can only load one playlist and download the one.
- Once the videos are loaded (they pop up in the box to the right), type in the name of the new folder in which it will be downloaded.
- Click apply to change to the folder name (auto set to \YTPD_Beta)
- Click Download to download music files, a loading bar will pop up.
- This downloads all the files to the selected folder on Desktop (can not be changed).

Use at your own risk, as downloading certain music/videos might be illegal due to copyrights.
