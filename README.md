# YouTubePlaylistDownloader
Simple youtube playlist downloader. 
It is mostly meant to download music as it only downloads videos in a MP4 format.

Beta version, there are still bugs.

If something went wrong(program didn't work correctly) it coul'd be due to an internal error, but is most likely due to:

### Possible Errors (Program not working correctly):
#### Playlist didn't load up:
- Playlist is set to private.
- Bad internet connection. (It has to be really bad to not work)
- Incorrect URL (Is not a YouTube playlist)
- Unknown Error 

#### If a certain video wasn't downloaded:
- It was deleted from the playlist (No longer exists)
- It was blocked by YouTube (Could be any reason)
- Blocked in country.
- Bad internet connection.
- Server connection error or unavailable format.
- Unknown Error
